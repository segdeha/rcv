Instant Runoff Voting Algorithm (Simplified Rounds):

Initialization:

- All candidates are "active."
- All ballots are "active" (not exhausted).

Repeat (for each round) until a winner is found:

1. Tally First Preferences:
- For every active ballot, identify its highest-ranked active candidate.
- Count the number of these "first preference" votes for each active candidate.

2. Check for Majority Winner:
- Calculate the total number of active ballots in this round.
- If any active candidate has more than 50% of the total active ballots' votes:
- That candidate wins. The process ends.

3. Elimination (If No Majority):
- Identify the active candidate(s) with the fewest first preference votes.
- Handle Ties for Fewest: If multiple candidates are tied for the fewest votes, apply a defined tie-breaking rule (e.g., eliminate the candidate who had fewer votes in the previous round, or randomly choose one, or eliminate all tied candidates if they are all at the bottom).
- Eliminate the identified candidate(s) from the set of active candidates.

4. Vote Redistribution:
- For every ballot that had the just-eliminated candidate(s) as its highest active preference:
- Find the next highest-ranked candidate on that ballot who is still active.
- Transfer that ballot's vote to this newly identified active candidate.
- If a ballot has no more ranked preferences for any active candidate:
- Mark that ballot as "exhausted." It will not contribute to future rounds.

5. Loop:
- Return to Step 1 (Tally First Preferences) with the updated set of active candidates and the redistributed votes.
